To the realest, baddest most caring person I know, you're finally 20! happy birthday shosh. Candles are'nt the only thing
getting hotter this year! THank you for filling my life with more love and happiness than I ever thought possible. Here's to another trip around the sun 
full of new experiences and adventures together. May God grant you all the desires of your heart, may He also give you the patience to wait for them 
and the wisdom to keep and multiply them. Happy birthday, mamaa. I love you!
